# CLAUDE.md

## Project overview

**Food Map** is a map-first mobile app for discovering restaurants and homemade food through country-flag markers, sending pickup and table requests, and keeping a personal food-photo log shown as a GitHub-style activity grid.

- Product spec (the *what*): `docs/product/v1.md`. Read the relevant section before any feature work.
- Feature specs (the *how*): `.claude/specs/NN-slug.md`, one per feature.
- Workflow guide for humans: `docs/workflow.md`

**Roles:** Archan is the project manager (approves specs, plans, reviews, merges). Claude is the senior developer (writes specs, plans, code, tests; runs reviews; ships via PR).

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| App | Expo (managed, CNG — no committed `ios/` or `android/`), React Native, TypeScript (strict) |
| Routing | expo-router (file-based, `app/` directory) |
| Backend | Supabase: Postgres, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions (Deno), Row Level Security |
| Server state | @tanstack/react-query wrapping supabase-js |
| Client state | React state first; Zustand only for cross-screen UI state |
| Map | react-native-maps + supercluster for clustering |
| Bottom sheet | @gorhom/bottom-sheet |
| Animation | react-native-reanimated (marker rise-and-fall) |
| Forms | react-hook-form + zod |
| Images | expo-image-picker, expo-image-manipulator (resize/compress), expo-image (display) |
| Push | expo-notifications |
| Tests | jest-expo + @testing-library/react-native; pgTAP via `supabase test db` |
| Build/Release | EAS Build + EAS Update |

**Where things belong:**
- New screen → `app/...` file that renders a component from `src/features/<feature>/components`
- Supabase queries → `src/features/<feature>/api.ts` only, never inside components or screens
- Data fetching in UI → react-query hooks in `src/features/<feature>/hooks/`
- Shared UI → `src/components/ui/`; colors/spacing → `src/theme/tokens.ts`
- Schema change → new migration in `supabase/migrations/` (created with `npx supabase migration new <name>`)
- Secrets or third-party API keys (e.g. Places autocomplete) → Supabase Edge Function, never in the app bundle

---

## Code style

- TypeScript strict, no `any` (use `unknown` + zod). Named exports. Function components only.
- Files: `PascalCase.tsx` for components, `camelCase.ts` for everything else. Feature folders kebab-case.
- Never hardcode colors, spacing or font sizes — use `src/theme/tokens.ts`.
- Every screen handles 4 states: loading, empty, error (with retry), success.
- Accessibility: every touchable has `accessibilityLabel` + `accessibilityRole`; touch targets ≥ 44pt; never convey meaning by color alone.
- Respect reduce-motion (`useReducedMotion` from reanimated) for any looping animation.
- Dates: store `timestamptz` in UTC; activity grid uses the stored `local_date` column.
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`.

## Supabase rules (non-negotiable)

- **RLS is ON for every table.** Every new table ships with its policies and a pgTAP test proving an outsider can't read/write what they shouldn't.
- **Ownership is enforced in the database** (RLS / security-definer functions), never only by hiding UI.
- **Status changes go through Postgres functions** (e.g. `respond_to_request(request_id, decision)`) that check the caller owns the business and the transition is valid.
- **Migrations are append-only.** Never edit a migration that exists on `main`. Fix forward with a new migration.
- After any migration: `npm run db:types` to regenerate `src/types/database.ts`.
- Storage buckets have policies: users write only to `<bucket>/<auth.uid()>/...`.
- Homemade exact addresses live in a separate table readable only by the owner and by customers with an **accepted** request.
- Timestamps that matter for rules (upload time, request time) are set by the server (`default now()`), never trusted from the client.
- Never use the `service_role` key in the app. Only Edge Functions may use it.

---

## Tech constraints

- No new dependency without listing it in the spec's **New dependencies** section. Install with `npx expo install` (keeps versions Expo-compatible).
- No Redux, no styled-components, no UI kits (NativeBase, Tamagui, etc.). Build on React Native primitives + our `ui/` components.
- No live/background location tracking. `expo-location` is allowed only for "center map on me" with foreground permission.
- No committed native folders (`ios/`, `android/`); configure through `app.config.ts` and config plugins.

## Commands

```bash
# Setup
npm install
npx supabase start            # local Supabase (needs Docker)
cp .env.example .env          # fill in local keys printed by supabase start

# Run
npx expo start                # dev server; press i / a for simulators
# Note: react-native-maps needs a dev build or Expo Go on device; web is not supported for the map.

# Quality
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test                      # jest
npm test -- path/to/file      # single file
npx supabase test db          # pgTAP database tests

# Database
npx supabase migration new <name>
npx supabase db reset         # LOCAL ONLY: re-applies migrations + seed.sql
npm run db:types              # regenerate src/types/database.ts
```
(Scripts are created in spec 01. Until then these may not exist.)

## Feature workflow (every feature, in order)

1. `/createspecs <n> <slug>` → spec file + `feature/<slug>` branch. **Archan reviews the spec.**
2. `/clear`, then `/start-feature <NN-slug>` → loads only this feature's context and says whether plan mode is required.
3. **Plan mode** (Shift+Tab twice) when the spec says `Plan mode: required` → Archan approves the plan → implement.
4. `/test-feature <NN-slug>` → tests written from the spec, then run.
5. `/code-review-feature <NN-slug>` → parallel security + quality review → Archan approves fixes.
6. `/ship-feature` → commit, push, PR, **wait for CI green**, squash-merge, update status table below.

## Context management policy

- One feature per session. Start each feature with `/clear` and `/start-feature`.
- Load only: this file, the feature spec, the product-spec section it cites, and files listed under **Context to load** in the spec.
- Use the Explore subagent for codebase searches so file dumps stay out of the main context.
- If the session gets long mid-feature, use `/compact` with a note of the current step, e.g. `/compact implementing step 3 of plan for 09-pickup-requests`.

## Plan mode policy

Plan mode is **required** when a feature: changes the database schema or RLS; touches more than ~5 files; adds a dependency; or changes navigation or auth. Otherwise optional. The spec's `Plan mode:` line is the decision; `/start-feature` repeats it.

## Subagent policy

- Use the built-in **Explore** subagent for codebase exploration before implementing.
- Use the built-in **Plan** subagent for research while in plan mode.
- Tests: `foodmap-test-writer` (writes from the spec) then `foodmap-test-runner` (runs + diagnoses). Never let the writer read the implementation.
- Reviews: `foodmap-security-reviewer` and `foodmap-quality-reviewer` in parallel.

## Feature status

Updated by `/ship-feature`. Do not implement a feature marked ⬜ unless the active spec targets it.

## Warnings and things to avoid

- **Never push to `main` directly** — always a feature branch + PR (a hook blocks this).
- **Never `git add .` or `git add -A`** — stage files by name; a hook blocks the bulk forms.
- **Never edit or read `.env`** — use `.env.example` for documentation (hooks + permissions block it).
- **Never edit an existing migration** — create a new one (a hook blocks edits to existing migration files).
- **Never run `supabase db reset --linked` or `supabase db push`** from a session — remote DB changes go through CI/release.
- **Never edit `src/types/database.ts` by hand** — regenerate it.
- **Never show a pending request as confirmed** anywhere in the UI.
- **Never show a homemade seller's exact address** before an accepted request.
- **Never build out-of-scope v1 items** listed in `docs/product/v1.md` §3.
